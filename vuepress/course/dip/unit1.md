# Unit I

## Definition

Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image to get an enhanced image, or to extract some useful information from it.

Digital image processing is manipulation of the digital images by using computers.

## Fundamental Steps Involved

1. **Image acquisition** ⟶ acquire image in the digital form from the camera, or storage.

2. **Image enhancement** ⟶ subjective enhancement of the image to improve the aesthetics of the image. Brightness, contrast, color adjustment, and saturation are some examples.

3. **Image restoration** ⟶ objective restoration of image using well defined mathematical and/or probabilistic models of image degradation.

4. **Color image processing** ⟶ color modeling and processing in a digital domain.

5. **Wavelets and multi-resolution processing** ⟶ foundation for representing images in various degrees of resolution. Images subdivision successively into smaller regions for data compression and for pyramidal representation.

6. **Compression** ⟶ reducing the storage required to save an image or the bandwidth to transmit it.

7. **Morphological processing** ⟶ tools for extracting image components that are useful in the representation and description of shape.

8. **Segmentation** ⟶ partition an image into its constituent parts or objects. One of the most difficult tasks in DIP.

9. **Representation and description** ⟶ transforming raw data into a form suitable for subsequent computer processing. Description deals with extracting attributes that result in some quantitative information of interest or are basic for differentiating one class of objects from another.

10. **Object recognition** ⟶ process that assigns a label. Example: assigning `vehicle` label to an object based on its descriptors.

11. **Knowledge base** ⟶ inference from the processed image. It can involve anything from simple process of detailing regions of an image where the information of interest is known to be located, to complex process of generation interrelated list of all major possible defects in a materials inspection problem.
